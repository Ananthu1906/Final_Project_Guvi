0,4,Value-for-money,"Software was a bit buggy (FIXED After update)

Light usage phone

Keeps up with day-to-day tasks

Battery life's been great so far (4days)

Camera is actually better than my poco F5

Performance is as expected

Love the design

Also the blue color has a nice grip

Only downside IN MY OPINION is it it would be a flat display and the cost is a lot to replace

Also it can play MAX 1440p videos with stuttering in 4k
Good enough for price tho

Other than that it's a decent phone (I gave it to m...

Flipkart is charging 59 rs for secured packing but they did worst packaging they send the mobile in small box without bubble wrap or any protection

.photo quality in daytime at natural sunlight is good by choosing 50 mp camera option
Indoor camera quality is average

.phone look premium curved display is good fingerprint scanner is f...

15,5,Excellent,"The phone is awesome and outstanding but Instead I would like to highlight some features that the phone lacks.

1st there is no inbuilt app lock.
2nd is there is no feature to show real time network speed or Internet speed.

3rd feature it lacks is auto switching 5G to 4G and vice versa.
Let's see what they do in upcoming updates. Fingers crossed.

If you are okay with it
Then go ahead."

Clean UI experience, some unnecessary apps are there but the good thing is you can remove them if you want to. From my POV this is the best midrange phone for daily usage or for the students, go for it. Thanks to Motorola and Flipkart."

20,4,Value-for-money,"Received this phone a week back.So far so good. Didnt get to test the camera extensively yet due to weather conditions not being favourable but as much as i have tested,looks promising. UI is clean except for some bloatwares which had to be manually uninstalled but thats fine. Only thing im missing in this phone is a dedicated gallery and a dialer app instead of the google apps the phone comes with. Nonetheless, solid phone for day to day basic usage(PS. i dont do gaming so the 6s gen3/695 is...
