I got my phone in 2 days .
I recently purchased the Redmi Note 13 Pro in Midnight Black with 256GB storage and 8GB RAM from Flipkart, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way.

Firstly, the delivery was prompt, and the phone arrived in perfect condition. The sleek and stylish Midnight Black design of the phone is stunning, and it feels premium in my hand.

The performance of the Redmi Note 13 Pro is outstanding, thanks ...

Performance - good
