iPhone heats a lot because of its built. Its frame is steel and the back is glass but it has great things when it gets hot, it restricts some features to cool it down.

The camera is good, sometimes it misses focus.

4,Nice product,"Overall good experience (4 months review)

Display : 60hz but impressive,

Camera: if lighting condition is good then it can click very good photos but incase of poor lighting not good experience at such price point.

Charging: Charging speed is quite good with 20w charger but at such price point it could be better.

5,Great product,"I wanted to buy yellow colour but that was not delivering on my pin code so went for this colour.

After receiving this, I have no regression.

Love this.

iPhone heats a lot because of its built. Its frame is steel and the back is glass but it has great things when it gets hot, it restricts some features to cool it down.

The camera is good, sometimes it misses focus.

I know in design it is similar to Iphone 13 but is specs aren't.
There is substantial difference in display, battery, speed as compared to iPhone 13.

Its-
Battery easily lasts more than 1 day in moderate usage.
Camera is fabulous.
Display is excellent.
Handy device.
But heats sometimes while executing smaller tasks.

I have Iphone Xs max. Its was a drastic upgrade from the same in terms of display, battery, speed ie hardware.

There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user.
Cons:
1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day.
2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is d...

if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.

Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.

In performance department as well it is excellent.
