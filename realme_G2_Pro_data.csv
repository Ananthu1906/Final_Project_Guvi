But the battery backup is poor.After Full charge it lasted around 4hr15mins. Bought this because old phone had battery drain issue, but this one is draining faster. The advantage is, it charges in 35mins.
I Thought that 2k display,120fps are the reasons for the drain , so I have set them to auto adjust mode , but still the battery drains in the same way....
Also you'll notice that battery drops a lot , even when it is left idle.

15,5,Terrific purchase,"You get more than what you pay for.
Software:
The UI is not fancy but much more practical than one UI or Funtouch OS. Also there's no noticeable bugs.
The memory management is commendable when you lock your most used apps.
Build:
The phone is beautiful. I got the paper white.
Sound:
The speaker hardwares are cheap but the Dolby Atmos has pushed them to perfection.
Vibration:
The haptic engine feels so satisfying.
Display:

18,5,Terrific,Overall a decent product . 35 mins to take full charge . Display is amazing ( 2 k ltpo amoled). cameras are good (expecting better because this is flagship). . Haptics are nice. Little bit warm while playing heavy games but cool down rapidly because of large cooling chamber.

27,4,Pretty good,"The Realme GT2 Pro, which I managed to snag for just 27k during the Big Billion Day sale, is truly a gem in its price range. With its Snapdragon 8gen1 processor, it delivers remarkable performance that's hard to find under the 30k mark. The camera also impresses, adding another feather to its cap.

In terms of user experience, it shines. The haptics are on point, making interactions smooth and enjoyable. This phone truly stands out as an all-rounder under 30k.

28,4,Good quality product,Battery backup is worst other than battery it's nice and overall performance is good
29,5,Must buy!,"A very good product in this price point.

Pros:-
I just love the performance, 120hz LTPO 2.0 display, stereo speaker, 360 degree NFC . Camera is ok, no hate no love. Battery also at the good side, which gives screen on time about 5 to 7 hours in daily uses.

Cons:-
Often it heats up little bit in normal multi tasking between 3 to 4 apps, and the ram management is also not good. My bluetooth is also malfunctioning with lower version of bluetooth devices."

camera 8/10 - Best camera for 33k.

Battery life 9/10 - lasts for 1 day, heavy usage 6 hrs.
35 MIN 0 to 100% charge
