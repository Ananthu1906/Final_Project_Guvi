3,5,Worth every penny,"As you know its a Vivo V series phone, the performance is good at this segment.

11,4,Very good camera centric smartphone,"Excellent camera smartphone in this price range. Display is also very good. I reduced one star because, haptic feedback is not good and absence of Dolby atoms make a big difference. it doesn't feel like it as stereo speakers.
My opinion is those who are looking for good camera phone, definitely can consider this Vivo v40 pro model"
12,5,Worth every penny,"Portrait is master level...performance is smoother than butter...no heating issue...very slim design...after using realme I'm satisfied with this design... display size is huge and quality is excellent...sound is loud...

Battery is good (average), I can spend my whole duty time, don't need to charge...after coming back to room it needed to get charged....

Overall experience is excellent...I'm satisfied with the product under 50k...."

15,5,Must buy!,"Bought this phone over Samsung galaxy s23 for the purpose of photography only. Surprisingly it can clicks awesome eye pleasing portraits with ample amount of detailing in 50mm although it loses details in 85mm. The front portraits are inconsistent. Aura light works effectively well in low light flash.
Videography could have been more stabilized in 4K.
