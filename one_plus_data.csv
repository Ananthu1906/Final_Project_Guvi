1. Battety is Very Good

134,3,Does the job,Rear camera poor quality. Bulky design.
135,4,Delightful,"The phone looks good but the back glass catches fingerprints easily. speed is ok for day-to-day use. In the room the light camera struggles to take clear pictures. But outside it takes sharp photos.
The front camera does a good job.
You can only shoot videos in 1080 resolution with 60 FPS, and the quality is below average.One of the best things about OnePlus phones is that their UI is free of annoying ads. However, there are some bloatware apps that come pre-installed. Battery Lasts all day...
