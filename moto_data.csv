All accessories were in the box, although the back cover is kind of useless.

7,5,Just wow!,"The beautiful beast is here!

Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.

Beautiful:
1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand.
2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium.
3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.

Beast:
1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.

Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't.
If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a
